## Day 2 Thoughts
### Part 1
The logic for the pulls was a bit strange to me, but somehow I was able to get this working. Lots of splitting and hashes.
Missed a good opportunity to use some procs and class structure, but I'm so far behind at this point, these may be a little hacky.

### Part 2
This one was a bit easier than Part 1. I was expecting to have to use `inject` at some point.

### Overall
Again, way behind, so these may be pretty rough!
